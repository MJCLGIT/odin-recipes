        <img src="finishedlemond.jpg">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <il>225g unsalted butter, softened</il>
            <il>225g caster sugar</il>
            <il>4 eggs</il>
            <il>225g self-raising flour</il>
            <il>1 lemon, zested</il>
            <il>1½ lemons, juiced</il>
            <il>85g caster sugar</il>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>STEP 1 - Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
            <li>STEP 2 - Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through.</li>
            <li>STEP 3 - Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>STEP 4 - Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.</li>
            <li>STEP 5 - Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.</li>
            <li>STEP 6 - While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemon juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle.</li>
            <li>STEP 7 - Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle – the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.</li>
            <li>STEP 8 - Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.</li>
        </ol>
        </ul>
